## Part-1 ( For Freshmen Year )
From the past few days, many freshmen year students are messaging me :

> " Hello Sir, Where should we start learning to be a developer or programmer ?"

Well, this question also arises when I was in my freshman year. I didn't know what to start and from where should I learn? So, I will share my experience to be a Developer and how can you?

## Competitive Programming
Competitive Programming is a sport where many developers code together to find one possible code that took less execution time and less memory space. I recommend for a freshman to start with Competitive Programming as soon as possible and practice daily.

### Why Competitive Programming is important ?
Competitive Programming makes our Data Structures strong and It is important for our placements. It is asked by Big MNC's like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. They conduct many programming competitions :
- Google Code Jam
- Facebook Hacker Cup
- Google Kickstart
- TCS Codevita
- CodeChef Snackdown

Get Into Local Tech Communities in you City or College

__Now, I know you all are having some questions in mind?__

## What are Communities ?
Communities are a group of developers who organize meetups on any technology and have a communication channel to be a part of those communities. It is important to be part of a community for networking as well as learning new things or in other words, you will have expert contacts and always learn new tech to start. You can also share your project idea and get started with a new team.

### How To Join these communities ?
The easiest way by going on meetup.com and search for your city technical groups by yourself and join their communication channel.
If your college or city has no community. What can you do?
A great saying by the great person always goes in my mind every day and I recommend you to follow it and it will take you one step closer to Leadership

> "Be the change that you wish to see in the world" - Mahatma Gandhi

If there are no communities nearby you then you can start your own community within the campus or city. Some exclusive communities every city or college should have:
- Google Developer Group ( GDG )
- Facebook Developer Circles
- Developer Student Club ( DSC for college)
- Women Techmakers
- Women Who Code

## Can I start my own community? YEP!

You can start your own community or club within your college but I can say from my personal experience that most of the times it shuts down. So, try to be a part of a factor where you have someone senior to report.
Representative for your campus

The campus representative is the new key for marketing but it also benefits for student developers to learn and be part of something big under many experts in one communication channel. Some Campus Representative programs that will change you and your career:
- Github Campus Expert (my personal favorite)
- Microsoft Student Partner
- Auth0 Ambassador

## Conclusion
Unfortunately, When I was in my freshmen year I can only crack the Competitive Programming part but didn't get any achievements. I write this article for those who didn't get either part of it. If any queries can contact me.
