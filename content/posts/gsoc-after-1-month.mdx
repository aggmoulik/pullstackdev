## About Me
My Name is Moulik Aggarwal. I am a final year student pursuing B.Tech from Amity University Rajasthan. I am an Open Source Contributor and NodeJS Developer. I am part of many technical communities like GDG, Facebook Developer Circles, PyJaipur, etc. I am currently working as a Google Summer of Code Student with Salesforce Organisation.

## My GSoC Project - oclif
### What is oclif?
Before coming to my exact project, you must know about the oclif i.e. Open CLI Framework. It is used for building a command line interface (CLI) in JavaScript and TypeScript. It can create single-command CLI ( e.g. `ls`, `curl` ) and multiple-command CLI ( e.g. `git`, `Heroku`).

### What I have to create for oclif?
I have to create a custom Linter for the oclif framework such that developers can create their CLI without any hassle and find the small bugs and errors easily and effectively. It will reduce the time for the bug fix due to functional errors in code.


## My Experience
On May 6th, I was waiting for the GSoC results from 11'o clock on the GSoC website and checking my emails every second. I knew that the result will announce at 11:30 p.m. but I was having too many butterflies in my stomach and I was eager to have my first big achievement.

At exact 11:30 p.m, GSoC result was announced and I was surprised and happy at the same moment of being selected for the Salesforce oclif project as well as for the first ever GSoCer from my University. So, It takes me to a whole new level of excitement.
Now, let me share my experience until now.

### Community Bonding Period
So, After I was selected I mailed by mentors to have some key points of my proposal and get familiar with the project. Then after some days, reply to my mail arrives to have a video call with me.
After the call, I have to create 2 npm packages i.e. one for the TypeScript developers and another one for the JavaScript developers. I was using TSLint and ESLint respectively as a base for my custom linter.
I didn't know anything on creating an npm package and I have to create not 1 but 2 packages so I was ready to accept the challenge.

### Week 1
So, I have to decide whether should I start with JavaScript or TypeScript. After long thinking, I decided to go for the TypeScript package. But I didn't know at that time, what is waiting for me?
This message gives me shock for a moment and I was now afraid to start again because all the things I researched and worked it was finished and long gone. But I got another good news i.e. now I have to create only 1 package for both Javascript and Typescript as they both are getting merge in another package typescript-eslint.

### Week 2 and Week 3
After some shock and happiness, I have to start from scratch to create our custom linter so that it can work as expected. I have contributed to the library for some time to get familiar with the new linter package and how to create a plugin for my organization.

### Week 4
I created the plugin for the oclif for the starter with only one custom rule and pushed to the repository. Before pushing to the repo, I integrate my plugin with the oclif generated CLI's and Voila! It worked.

### What did I learn?
- New Programming Language i.e. TypeScript,
- Creating a plugin as a custom linter with typescript-eslint,
- Creating new rules in TypeScript,
- Testing NPM package locally without publishing to npm,
- Publishing TypeScript Package to NPM.


## Conclusion
I am really thankful to the mentors Travis Longoria and Philipe Navarro, for selecting me as their GSoC Student and I looking forward to becoming the main contributor of the project.
