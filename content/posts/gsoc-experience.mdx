## Introduction
I am Moulik Aggarwal, a computer science and engineering geek from Amity University Rajasthan, Jaipur, India. I always want to work on Cloud and Web technologies 3. I love to contribute to Open Source as well as I am also an Open Source Influencer and love to work with different communities in my city e.g. Facebook Developer Circles Jaipur, GDG Jaipur, PyJaipur and many more.

## What was my open source experience before this project?
I started contributing in October 2018 in Hacktoberfest. I started contributing in small projects so that I can learn the working of git and GitHub. Then I have a pause for almost a month until I started again contributing in good and growing projects this winter by NJACK by IIT Patna and KWoC by IIT Kharagpur. If you want to know more About KWoC and my contributions.

## Why did I work on this particular project?
There were many projects but most of them were on Python and ML. But I want to work on software development and I love to do that using NodeJS. So, I have very less scope for working in a project as I need but I found out about Salesforce open source framework oclif. I found out the project they want to work on is creating an oclif Linter so that they can have their own style guide for their developers as well as for the developers using oclif for their personal projects. I really love the idea and started researching for the project and created my proposal within 2 days of researching.

## What was the most challenging thing about my experience?
The most challenging part was to create a new package from the scratch which I never did that. The next thing I faced is we have to change our plan of action for the package because of deprecation of TSLint and we have to use a new package i.e. typescript-eslint for Typescript as well as JavaScript. I have to learn without any reference from the developers of typescript-eslint on creating custom rules in Typescript. In the end, the whole GSoC part was not planned everything is random and we still have a lot of things to do.

## Advice for new contributors in Open Source
There are many projects and organizations to work with so I have some points for you all to work on with:
- Start with any organization or project even a smaller so that you all know on how to make contributions.
- Choose your project in which you want to work on.
- Before Contributing, you must setup your project in your local machine
- Connect with mentors as much as you can and discuss small issues as well in the GitHub issues.

## Advantages of Open Source for my career
Before I tell you about the advantages of open source in your career you must know something about the relationship of GSoC and open source.

It is nothing on preparing it is not an exam that everyone has to pass. GSoC is introduced to promote open source and students can work on real-life projects and learn and do work in real-world with the professionals. So, I suggest you to start working in any organization and contribute without any expectations and when the day comes you will know what you have to do. Do work in Open Source when you feel it otherwise doesn't do it.

Now It is time for you to know the benefits of working in open source projects:
It will develop your Software Engineering skills like working on small modules for a product.

- You will learn how to manage a project on large as well as small scales.
- Learn new things with a project as a base.
- You will also learn CI/CD as it is needed nowadays.
- Your regularity is measured by GitHub Contributions Tracker.
- Many startups and companies also have a look at your GitHub profile that can make an advantage for you 
- and many more...

## Conclusion
I loved to work with Salesforce and I will continue to maintain the project and contribute to the project. There are many projects on Salesforce in different fields. I prefer to see the projects on Salesforce Open Source.

I am thankful for my mentors Philipe Navarro ([RasPhilCo](https://github.com/RasPhilCo)) and Travis Longoria ([elbandito](https://github.com/elbandito)) of the project who were there to guide me.
